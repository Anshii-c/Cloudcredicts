# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements a pipeline to detect fraudulent financial transactions using both supervised classification techniques and unsupervised anomaly detection methods. It leverages Random Forests, Autoencoders, and PCA for feature analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview

- Detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data.
- Handle imbalanced datasets with appropriate metrics.
- Visualize transaction patterns and model predictions.
- Deployable via Flask or integrated with GUI frameworks like Tkinter.


##  Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description**: Contains anonymized features (`V1`â€“`V28`) generated using PCA, along with `Amount`, `Time`, and `Class` (target variable).
